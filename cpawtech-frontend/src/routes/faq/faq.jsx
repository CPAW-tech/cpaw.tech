                    How does cpaw.tech work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Students create profiles showcasing their tech skills and
                    interests. Nonprofits post projects detailing their
                    technical needs. Our platform allows students to match and
                    apply to relevant positions that align with their skills and
                    goals. Once matched, teams collaborate to complete projects,
                    with students gaining experience and nonprofits achieving
                    their objectives.
